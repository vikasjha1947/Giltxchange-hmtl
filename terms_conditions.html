				</p>
				
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				
				<p>Giltxchange and the User are aware that although there is no legal bar or impediment to trading in Virtual Currencies in India at the moment, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has issued a press release no. 2013-2014/1261 dated 24th December 2013 whereby it has stated that "The creation, trading or usage of VCs including Bitcoins, as a medium for payment are not authorised by any central bank or monetary authority. No regulatory approvals, registration or authorisation is stated to have been obtained by the entities concerned for carrying on such activities. As such, they may pose several risks to their users". The press release further states that the RBI is still "examining the issues associated with the usage, holding and trading of VCs under the extant legal and regulatory framework of the country". The full text of the said press release can be found at Here The User is hereby made aware of the nebulous legal situation regarding Virtual Currencies and Giltxchange shall not be liable for any proceedings against the User in any Court of law or before any governmental, administrative, regulatory, judicial or quasi judicial authority. 
				</p>
				
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				
				<p>Although the press release by the RBI mentions the risks associated with all virtual currencies including Virtual Currencies, it does not specifically bar them. Keeping in mind some of the risks mentioned in the press release by the RBI Giltxchange has drafted a Privacy Policy as well as a KYC Policy which are available on the Giltxchange website and the User specifically agrees to the terms contained in both the above mentioned policies.
				</p>
				
				<p>&nbsp;</p>								
				<p><strong>RISKS</strong></p>
								
				<p>The User acknowledges that he is fully aware of the risks involved in online trading activities, including the risk involved due to unauthorized access or any technical difficulties. Furthermore, in a technical environment, should an error occur with respect to the tracking of any account holding or order entry, the true, actual and correct transaction or position may not be restored. It is the User's responsibility to ensure account correctness and accuracy and to contact Giltxchange immediately in respect of any discrepancies. 	
				</p>
				
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				
				<p>Users are advised to use the content and data on the website for the purpose of information only and rely on their own judgment while making investment or trading decisions. In case Giltxchange gives any information on the website, such information shall not be considered as advice of any kind and the User shall use its own judgment to make all decisions. 	
				</p>
				
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				
				<p>Giltxchange does not make any personal recommendations. The information on our website is provided solely to enable Users to make their own investment or trading decisions and does not constitute a recommendation to buy, sell or otherwise deal in Virtual Currencies. 	
				</p>
				
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				
				<p>The price and value of investments in Virtual Currencies and the income derived from them can go up or down and you may not get back the capital invested. Changes in the rate of exchange may have an adverse effect on the value, price and value of your investment. Past performance is not necessarily an indicator of future performance. The services and investments in Virtual Currencies may have tax consequences and it is important to bear in mind that Giltxchange does not provide any tax advice regarding Virtual Currencies and the increase or decrease in their value. The level of taxation depends on individual circumstances and such levels and bases of taxation can change. You should consult your own Tax Advisor in order to understand any applicable tax consequences. 	
				</p>
				
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				
				<p>Virtual Currencies trading has specific risks, which are not shared with other official currencies, goods or commodities in a market. Unlike most currencies, which are supported by government reserves or other legal entities, as well as commodities such as silver and gold, Virtual Currencies is a "flat" currency, which is only backed by mathematics, technology and trust. The currency is absolutely decentralized, which means there is no authority that can take corrective measure to protect the Virtual Currencies value in a crisis or issue more currency. When using Virtual Currencies - traders put their trust in the digital, decentralized and mostly anonymous system, which relies on P2P networking and cryptography to maintain its integrity. Trading in Virtual Currencies is susceptible to irrational or rational bubbles or absolute loss of confidence, which could collapse demand/supply. Any actions, even remotely connected to Virtual Currencies can crash confidence in this currency, such as unexpected changes imposed by the currency developers, a government crackdown, the creation of a superior competing Virtual Currencies alternative, or even a deflation or inflation spiral. Confidence might also collapse because of various technical problems: if the anonymity of the system can be compromised, funds lost or stolen, or in the event that hackers or governments become able to prevent Virtual Currencies transactions from settling. Giltxchange shall not be liable for any loss caused to the User due to any of the risks related to trading in Virtual Currencies, whether currently known or unknown. 	
				</p>
				
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				
				<p>Virtual Currencies purchased using a bank account or credit card or any other deposit method may be reversed at a later time, for example, if such a payment is subject to a chargeback, reversal, claim or is otherwise invalidated. A Virtual Currencies transaction may be unconfirmed for a period of time (usually less than one hour, but up to one business day) and never complete if it is in a pending state.

				<p><strong>RULES</strong></p>								
				<p>"The Trade Engine" is a live Virtual Currencies trading platform whereby the Users can use real money to buy and sell actual Virtual Currencies from their Accounts with Giltxchange.  	
				</p>
				
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				
				<p><strong>Opening Account And Starting – </strong></p>
				<p>Once the User creates an Account by registering with Giltxchange, the User will be allowed to place orders in the exchange area. Each Account will be linked with the User's bank account as per the details provided by the User who can use the money in such linked bank account and start trading with other users. Once the User enters the trading area the User will see the following displays: </p>
				
				
				<p><strong>My Wallet – </strong></p>
				<p>The Users will also be able to view the available and on hold balance in their account at all times. A Users account balance shall display the Virtual Currencies balance as well as INR balance currently in the User's account. </p>
				
				<p><strong>Markets –</strong></p>
				<p>The Users will also be able to view the available markets where he/she can trade at any time. The market will display the "Last Price", "Best Bid" and "Best Ask" as per Giltxchange. We do not show any other exchanges' prices. </p>
				
				
				<p><strong>Orders – </strong></p>
				<p>"Orders" is the trade book where an user can see the available orders from all other users to be fulfilled. "Orders" shows "Bid" and "Ask". A "Bid" table contains the details of the orders which shall be filled by placing a "Sell order". An "Ask" table contains the details of the orders which shall be filled by placing a "Buy order". When an order is placed, the trade engine automatically matches it with other orders in the trade book at best prices and available volumes. </p>
				
				
				<p><strong>My Orders –</strong></p>
				<p>"My Orders" displays all of the User's pending trade requests (Both Buy and Sell transactions) that are yet to be executed/ completed /cancelled/ partially filled. In the event that a User's trade has not been completed/ partially filled, the User can choose to cancel the order by clicking on the 'X' icon corresponding to such trade request that is pending. Please note that a trade request can only be cancelled when it's still pending and reflecting under the 'Open' link in 'My Orders'. Once a transaction has been executed/ completed, it may no longer be cancelled. Under the 'Closed' link in 'My Orders', users will be able to see all the completed/ cancelled trades (both Buy and Sell transactions) pertaining to the User. </p>
				
				
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				
				<p><strong>Buying Virtual Currencies</strong> </p>
				<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> In the event that User intends to purchase Virtual Currencies, the User is required to place a trade request with the exchange platform for the same. User can choose to place orders at Limit or at Market. In order to place a limit order, user shall specify the amount of Virtual Currencies and the price at which user intends to buy. In order to place a market order, user shall specify how much he/she is willing to pay in total for the order. User shall understand the risk of any losses occured due to lack of knowledge of the "Limit Order" or "Market Order". User can place order in the order book by clicking the button "Buy"</p>
								
				<p><strong>Step 2:</strong>Once the User clicks on "Buy", the trade engine automatically picks the order and executes it with other orders in the order book if orders match or keep it in the order book for future executions</p>
								
				<p><strong>Step 3:</strong>In the event that there is a pending "Sell Order" for the price at which the User's bid has been placed, the order would be executed immediately and the User's balance would reflect the updated statistics. This can be achieved by matching the User's order with a single order of such quantity and price, if available or if a single order with the required price and amount is not pending, the trade engine will complete the User's order by matching it with multiple orders and then complete the User's order in multiple tranches. </p>
								
				<p><strong>Step 4:</strong>If a User's trade request does not match with any of the existing requests on the trading platform, then such request shall automatically move into the waiting list of pending transactions for it to be matched with an appropriate "Sell Order" as and when such a request is received. In this case, the User's balance would remain intact until the transaction is completed. While the transaction is pending, the User may cancel the transaction through the "My Orders" section as explained above.</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				
				
				<p><strong>Selling Virtual Currencies</strong></p>				
				<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> In the event that User intends to sell Virtual Currencies, the User is required to place a trade request with the exchange platform for the same. User can choose to place orders at Limit or at Market. In order to place a limit order, user shall specify the amount of Virtual Currencies and the price at which user intends to sell. In order to place a market order, user shall specify how much volume of Virtual Currencies, he/she is willing to sell in total for the order. User shall understand the risk of any losses occured due to lack of knowledge of the "Limit Order" or "Market Order". User can place order in the order book by clicking the button "Sell". </p>
				
				<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Once the User clicks on "Sell", the trade engine automatically picks the order and executes it with other orders in the order book if orders match or keep it in the order book for future executions.  </p>
				
				<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> In the event that there is a pending "Buy Order" for the price at which the User's bid has been placed, the order would be executed immediately and the User's balance would reflect the updated statistics. This can be achieved by matching the User's order with a single order of such quantity and price, if available or if a single order with the required price and amount is not pending, the trade engine will complete the User's order by matching it with multiple orders and then complete the User's order in multiple tranches.</p>
				
				<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> If a User's trade request does not match with any of the existing requests on the trading platform, then such request shall automatically move into the waiting list of pending transactions for it to be matched with an appropriate "Buy Order" as and when such a request is received. In this case, the User's balance would remain intact until the transaction is completed. While the transaction is pending, the User may cancel the transaction through the "My Orders" section as explained above.</p>
